NAME
       ddupr - Command line frontend for App::DDup

VERSION
       0.001

DESCRIPTION
       Identifying duplicated files in a given directory with the option of
       removing the duplicates. Developed as a submission to the DFW hackathon.

USAGE
       Usage:
            ddupr [OPTIONS]

REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
       Required:
           --dir   - Str. Directory to search.

OPTIONS
       Optional:
            --help -? --usage - Bool. Display the usage message and exit
            --man             - Bool. Display man page
            --head_size       - Int. Default=4096. Use this max length
                                  (bytes) when looking into a files.
            --block_size      - Int. Default=65536. Use block size
                                  (bytes) to reading files.
            --remove          - Bool. Delete the identified duplicates.
            --format          - Str. Default=robot. Output format to use
                                  (human or robot).
            --checksum        - Str. Default=Digest::xxHash. Digest
                                  algorithm to use (Digest::MD5, Digest::SHA1 or
                                  Digest::xxHash). While xxHash is faster, MD5 is
       more
                                  reliable.
            --silent          - Bool. If set, no information will be printed.

EXIT STATUS
       0 or die if a file cannot be opened;

DIAGNOSTICS
       Crital errors are generated in two scenarios:

       If a file cannot be opened: the program will "die" (via Carp::confess) and
       an error message indicating which file that could not be opened for reading
       and an explanation.

       If a file cannot be deleted (if the "remove" setting is used): the program
       will "die" (via Carp::confess) and an error message indicating which file
       could not be removed.

       Warning messages are generated (via Carp::carp) if a file handled
       previously opened could not be closed, also indicating the file.

CONFIGURATION
       All configuration are controlled via the above mentioned options.
